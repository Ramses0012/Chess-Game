# Chess-Game
Author: Ramses Cardenes

Hello, in this chess game all the game features and structure and logic of the game was provided. I implemented all sounds, timers,and listBox and work as expected. 
Also, when Clicking on the moves in the history should modify the piece arrangement to the selected moment in the game, which is also 
tested and perfectly works in this chess game.
